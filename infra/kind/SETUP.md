# K8s Infrastructure for nemo-rl

## Overview

This gives you a local GPU-enabled K8s playground for testing RL workloads — all you need is Docker and an NVIDIA GPU. The same example manifests can be brought to a production K8s cluster, but you may need to adapt them (work with your cluster operator).

The helmfile here is for convenience. A production system should manage these components in Terraform or another infrastructure-as-code solution.

## Prerequisites

- Docker with systemd cgroup driver and **cgroup v2**
- NVIDIA driver installed on host (`nvidia-smi` works)
- `nvidia-container-toolkit` installed on host
- `go` (for nvkind installation)
- `helmfile` (install: `curl -sSL https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/releases/latest/download/helmfile_$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz -C ~/bin helmfile`)

### One-time host setup (requires sudo)

```sh
# Set nvidia as Docker's default runtime and enable CDI
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker --set-as-default --cdi.enabled
sudo nvidia-ctk config --set accept-nvidia-visible-devices-as-volume-mounts=true --in-place
sudo systemctl restart docker

# Verify
docker info | grep "Default Runtime"   # should show "nvidia"
stat -fc %T /sys/fs/cgroup/            # should show "cgroup2fs"
```

## Quick Start (local kind cluster)

```sh
# 1. Install tools
cd infra/kind
bash install-nvkind.sh
bash get-kubectl.sh
bash get-helm.sh

# 2. Create cluster (all host GPUs exposed to a single worker node)
bash create-cluster.sh

# 3. Deploy infrastructure (KAI scheduler, KubeRay, JobSet controller)
cd ../helm
helmfile -e kind sync

# 4. Create KAI scheduler queues + RBAC
kubectl apply -f ../examples/kai-queue.yaml
kubectl apply -f ../examples/endpoint-registry-rbac.yaml

# 5. Deploy a workload (pick one)
kubectl apply -f ../examples/rayjob-monolithic.yaml      # single-cluster RayJob
kubectl apply -f ../examples/disagg-rayclusters.yaml      # disagg via KubeRay
kubectl apply -f ../examples/disagg-jobset.yaml           # disagg via JobSet
```

### Testing locally with kind

Once the cluster is up, you can:

```sh
kubectl get rayclusters -w           # watch cluster status
kubectl get jobsets.jobset.x-k8s.io  # watch JobSet status
kubectl get pods -o wide             # see pod placement and IPs
kubectl logs <pod-name>              # check logs

# Exec into RL head to run training manually:
kubectl exec -it <rl-head-pod> -c ray-head -- bash
cd /workspace/nemo-rl
python examples/nemo_gym/run_grpo_nemo_gym.py +env.disagg_job_id=my-job logger.wandb_enabled=false
```

## Deploy on a real cluster

```sh
cd infra/helm
helmfile -e prod sync
kubectl apply -f infra/examples/kai-queue-prod.yaml
```

This installs the full **GPU Operator** (instead of just the device plugin) along with KAI scheduler, KubeRay, and JobSet. The GPU Operator manages the NVIDIA driver, container toolkit, device plugin, NFD, and DCGM exporter.

Set `driver.enabled=false` in `values/gpu-operator.yaml` if the cluster nodes already have the NVIDIA driver installed.

## Architecture

### Colocated (single Ray cluster)

All components run on a single RayCluster — vLLM generation, Megatron training, and Gym environment servers are colocated as Ray actors on the same cluster.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              RayCluster / RayJob            │
│                                             │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  │
│  │ vLLM     │  │ Megatron │  │ Gym      │  │
│  │ (GPU)    │  │ (GPU)    │  │ (CPU)    │  │
│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  │
│           All on same Ray cluster           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Example: `rayjob-monolithic.yaml` — a single RayJob with head + GPU workers. KubeRay manages the lifecycle.

### Disaggregated (separate RL + Gym clusters)

The RL cluster (vLLM + Megatron) and Gym cluster (environment servers) run independently and communicate over HTTP. A K8s ConfigMap acts as an endpoint registry for dynamic URL exchange — RL publishes vLLM URLs, Gym publishes its head server address.

```
┌──────────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────────┐
│    RL Ray Cluster        │     │    Gym Ray Cluster       │
│                          │     │                          │
│  ┌──────┐  ┌──────────┐ │     │  ┌──────────┐            │
│  │ vLLM │  │ Megatron │ │     │  │ Gym      │            │
│  │ (GPU)│  │ (GPU)    │ │     │  │ servers  │            │
│  └──┬───┘  └──────────┘ │     │  └────┬─────┘            │
│     │                    │     │       │                   │
└─────┼────────────────────┘     └───────┼───────────────────┘
      │                                  │
      │     ┌──────────────────┐         │
      └────►│ ConfigMap        │◄────────┘
             │ (endpoint        │
             │  registry)       │
             └──────────────────┘
             vLLM URLs ←→ Gym address
```

There are two ways to deploy the disagg architecture:

#### Option A: Two KubeRay RayClusters (`disagg-rayclusters.yaml`)

- KubeRay operator manages each RayCluster independently
- **Failure cascading** requires a peer-watcher sidecar on each head pod (inlined Python script that monitors the peer cluster via K8s API and tears down both on failure)
- **Startup ordering** is implicit — both clusters start simultaneously, the endpoint registry handles coordination
- **Gang-of-gang scheduling** is not natively supported by KAI — each RayCluster gets its own PodGroup, and KAI cannot gang two PodGroups together. See [KAI issue #1420](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1420). The peer-watcher is a workaround
- **ConfigMap** is required for both vLLM URL exchange and Gym head address discovery

#### Option B: Single JobSet (`disagg-jobset.yaml`)

- JobSet controller manages all pods as a single unit (no KubeRay needed for lifecycle)
- **Failure cascading** is native via `failurePolicy: FailJobSet` — any job failure tears down everything
- **Startup ordering** uses init containers (not `dependsOn` — see note below). Workers wait for their head via `ray health-check` polling, same pattern as KubeRay
- **Gang scheduling** works naturally — KAI creates one PodGroup for the entire JobSet, so all pods are gang-scheduled together
- **DNS names** are predictable (`disagg-job-rl-head-0-0.disagg-job`), so the Gym head address can be hardcoded instead of discovered via ConfigMap. However, **ConfigMap is still needed for vLLM URL exchange** — vLLM binds to a dynamic IP:port inside the RL worker, which isn't known until runtime

> [!NOTE]
> **Why not `dependsOn`?** KAI gang-schedules all pods in a JobSet together (one PodGroup with `minMember` = total pods). `dependsOn` prevents dependent pods from being created until the head is Ready. This deadlocks: KAI waits for all pods to exist, JobSet waits for the head to be scheduled. The fix is to create all pods simultaneously and use init containers for ordering.

## Helmfile environments

| Environment | GPU component | Use case |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| `kind` | nvidia-device-plugin | Local dev — nvkind handles toolkit/runtime |
| `prod` | gpu-operator (full) | Real clusters — operator manages everything |

Both environments include KAI scheduler, KubeRay operator, and JobSet controller.

## Tear down (kind only)

```sh
kind delete cluster --name nemo-rl
```

## Notes

- **nvkind vs vanilla kind**: nvkind automates GPU device injection, nvidia-container-toolkit installation inside nodes, containerd nvidia runtime configuration, and RuntimeClass registration.
- **nvidia-device-plugin** (kind only): The full GPU Operator fails in kind because its driver validation doesn't work inside kind nodes. The lightweight device plugin with CDI discovery is sufficient since nvkind handles the runtime setup.
- **KAI scheduler** creates PodGroups automatically for recognized workload types (RayCluster, Job, PyTorchJob, JobSet, etc.). For bare pods, create a PodGroup manually and annotate with `pod-group-name`.

## Fairshare scheduling

KAI distributes GPU resources using hierarchical fair-share with two phases:
1. **Guaranteed quota**: Each queue gets its `quota` first, unconditionally.
2. **Over-quota surplus**: Remaining GPUs distributed by `priority` (higher served first), then `overQuotaWeight` within the same priority level.

### Queue fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `quota` | Guaranteed GPUs. `-1` = unlimited, `0` = no guarantee |
| `limit` | Hard cap on total GPUs. `-1` = no limit |
| `overQuotaWeight` | Weight for surplus distribution (higher = bigger share) |
| `priority` | Over-quota allocation order (higher = served first, reclaimed last) |
| `preemptMinRuntime` | Min runtime before a higher-priority queue can preempt (default: `"4h"`) |
| `reclaimMinRuntime` | Min runtime before over-quota resources can be reclaimed (default: `"15m"`) |

### Preempt vs reclaim

- **Preempt**: A higher-priority queue takes from a lower-priority queue. (VIP takes your table.)
- **Reclaim**: A queue takes back what it's entitled to from an over-allocated queue. (Fairness — give back what you owe.)

`reclaimMinRuntime` is shorter than `preemptMinRuntime` because reclaim is about fairness (returning over-quota resources quickly), while preempt protects long-running jobs from priority-based interruption.

### Example configs

- `kai-queue.yaml` — 2-GPU kind cluster (high-prio + low-prio)
- `kai-queue-prod.yaml` — 288-GPU NVL72 production cluster (priority + community departments)

## TODO: NVL72 topology-aware scheduling

KAI v0.14.0 added Ray topology-aware subgroup scheduling ([PR #1125](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1125)). Need to test on an actual NVL72 cluster:

- **Confirm `--segment=N` equivalent works**: KAI's `subGroups` with per-subgroup `topologyConstraint.requiredTopologyLevel: "rack"` should be the equivalent of Slurm's `--segment=N`. Each subgroup of N nodes is constrained to one rack. Unclear if this works correctly for cross-rack scheduling (e.g., `--segment=16` with 32 total nodes = 2 racks).
- **Auto-segmentation not yet implemented**: The design doc at [`docs/developer/designs/segmented-subgroups/`](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/blob/main/docs/developer/designs/segmented-subgroups/README.md) proposes `kai.scheduler/segment-size` annotation for automatic subgroup creation, but it depends on "Replica-Type SubGrouping" which isn't shipped yet. See [Issue #1189](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1189) and [PR #1127](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1127) (minSubGroup field, still open).

## TODO: Log persistence

Currently, logs are lost when RayJob pods are cleaned up (`ttlSecondsAfterFinished`). Two levels of log persistence are needed:

1. **Container stdout/stderr** (`kubectl logs`): Captured by containerd at `/var/log/pods/` on the node, but not queryable after pod deletion.
2. **Ray file logs** (`/tmp/ray/session_*/logs/`): Worker/driver logs, system logs — not sent to stdout at all.

**Planned approach**: Deploy a Loki stack (Loki + Promtail + Grafana) via helmfile for both `kind` and `prod` environments:
- Promtail DaemonSet captures container stdout/stderr from each node, auto-labels with K8s metadata (namespace, pod, job name)
- Fluent Bit sidecar in each RayJob pod tails `/tmp/ray` logs and ships to Loki
- Grafana UI for querying logs by job name, time range, and content (LogQL)
- kind: Loki stores on local PVC; prod: Loki stores on S3/GCS
